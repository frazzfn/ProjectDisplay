logging function used saying how many remaining password attempts left


try and except function for madison command 

code is going to be super easy, probs going to bang this out tonight and then come up with more ideas 
for possible apis etc to be added.. i have a few features to implement which is outside the realms of
the gui functions so this is a best case.
coding a test version just to get used to features.. its actually super easy which is great 

going to be using render callbacks, this allows me to use a special callback which is trigged upon 
an event, such as window closing or resizing.. im going to attempt to add a if button is clicked 3 
times then close window and present new window.. i dont know if this will be done with making the 
2nd window whether it will be showing or not set to False and then when the render callback is ran
changing that value to True and closing the first window.

get the scripts running and then turn into a portfolio. 
TOMORROW WE GET IT DONE ALL DAYY
LEARN HOW TO CONNECT A API BY DOING A STEP BY STEP RUN THROUGH OF A SPOTIFY API AS IT IS EASY TO 
FOLLOW ALONG!!!!!
