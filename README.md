# ProjectDisplay
This includes the DearPyGUI application made to display my projects
When creating this project i initially wanted to make it so it automatically ran as soon as i turned on my computer, so i turned it into a executable and added a password page (the password is cheese if you would like to try the code). 

When the buttons are clicked the callback func simply runs an imported py file, however from the password to the password window to the main window, the logic was that if the password page does not exist then present the main window, this was created with an if loop inside of a func so i can simply call the function whenever needed.
